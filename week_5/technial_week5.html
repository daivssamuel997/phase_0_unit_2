			<h1>Ruby has...classes?</h1>

			<p> 
				I took a class on Java my freshman year of college and the professor started out by saying this.."Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object and classes are what makes these objects come to life." Now Ruby and Java are two different programming languages, but they are both object-oriented. Thus, everything in Ruby is also an object and classes serve as the blueprints that make these objects real. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Individual objects are created in Ruby and generally, they are all instances of some other being. For example, an Iphone is an instance in the class of objects known as phone.
			</p>

			<p>
				Other languages, such as Java, have other variables of their own, like Static variables for example in Java, but in Ruby we only have these four..<br></br>

				Local variables: These are the variables that are defined in a method. Local variables are not available to any other methods besides the method that it was declared in. <br></br>

				Instance variables: These babies are available for every method for any instance or object. Instance variables do change from object to object. They are declared with a "@".<br></br>

				Class varaibles: These are available across many different objects. It belongs to the class and is a characteristic of the class. They are declared by "@@". They are however not available across different classes.<br></br>

				Global variables: These work similar to class variables, except that they are available across classes. This variable is preceded by the "$" sign.<br></br>

				You create objects in a class in Ruby by using the new method.
