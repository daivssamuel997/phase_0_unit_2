			<h1>Technology</h1>

			<p>
				According to the Wall Street Journal, one of the biggest problems with technology today would be that it simply just doesn't work in the manner that it was intended to. A great example would be printers. Printers always seem to be malfunctioning. In school, you hear the excuse that the "printer didn't work and that is why I couldn't do the homework". The real issue isn't the printer, it is that people rely so much on technology.

				Technology is great and it is amazing to just think about how far we have come, but sometimes it is a good idea to put the phone down and go for a walk. The issue of the homework and the printer could have been solved if the homework had been done earlier. He or she could have hand wrote the assignment or just used a different printer.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is true that today we usually have greater consequences when the technology doesn't work, but we do not have to let technology influence our people skills. One way that can be ready for when technology fails is to plan ahead. Have a backup plan. If you are giving a speech and using a powerpoint presentation, store your powerpoint on a flashdrive, the cloud, and email it to yourself. Help to eliminate the negative effects of technology failure.

				Cell phones are great, but just be sure to be present with someone if you are with them. I learned this lesson the hard way when I hurt my brother's feelings by being on my cell phone when he and I would go to dinner. Just remember that there is a time and a place for everything and cell phones/technology will never be able to replace actaul communication skills. Those will always be valuable.
