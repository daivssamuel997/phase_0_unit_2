			<h1>Object-Oriented Programming vs. Functional Programming</h1>

			<p>
				Well what is object-oriented programming or OOP first of all? OOP is a programming language that goes about representing data and concepts as "objects". These "objects" have data fields and methods that help to build them up. The coolest thing is that objects are generally instances of classes that can interact with other objects to achieve amazing things. C++, Java, Python, and Ruby are some of the most popular OOP languages. So for example, if you wanted to create an object for a Toyota Yaris, that would be an istance of a car class. This class would have several methods to help make this car come alive. It might have a method for gas, color, miles per gallon, year, model, etc. There are so many things that you can do with objects and the possibilites are pretty much endless. It is up to you to make them come to life.

				Fuctional programming languages do not deal with objects and mutable data, but instead, focus on building structures and high power functions. C, for example, is a programming language that relies on simplifying code, usually through the use of recursive functions, to make the Big O runtime of the program as fast as possible. Well, what is a recursive function exactly and can it be utilized in OOP? You can write recursive "methods" in OOP, but it may not always be necessary, for usually many lines of code in a functional programming language can be written in just a few in an OOP language. For a funciton to be recursive, this just means that it calls itself in order to come up with the desired outcome. By setting a base case, or a check to get out of function, you can manipulate data over and over again in order to get a simplier result. This is a handy trick because recursive functions often save the time and code of actually iterating through some data. <br></br>

				Here is an example of a recursive function sums up all of the numbers of 0 to n. <br></br>

				This code is written in C.<br></br>

				// Assume n is a non-negative integer.<br></br>

			int sum(int n) { <br></br>
				
					// Base case<br></br>
					if (n == 0)<br></br>
						return 0;<br></br>

					return n + sum(n - 1);<br></br>
				}
