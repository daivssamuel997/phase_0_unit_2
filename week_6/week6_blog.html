			<h1>Stereotype threat?</h1>

			<p>
				I can't think of a time that I felt like I was being stereotyped necessarily, but I do have a similar story to share. Growing up in an Iowan town, where 95% of my grade was white, I never really grow up with diversity with languages. Everyone spoke English and English only. My Spanish teachers were white as well. When I moved to Florida for senior year and enrolled in Honors Spanish 4, I was shocked to figure out that this class was much, and I mean much harder than the Spanish classes that I had taken previously. My teacher was Venezuelan and he spoke so quickly that I really couldn't understand I single word that he was saying. <br></br>

				That being said, the Spanish class was a great experience for me because it really made me realize just how important Spanish is because Spanish really is a huge language in Florida and other southern states. Learning Spanish in that class may have been difficult and even a little uncomfortable, I know that it was really worth it. The move to Florida was a great move for me and this was just one of the many reasons why.
